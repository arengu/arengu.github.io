Our forms module allows you to capture leads without spending any minute developing the form in your frontend nor the related business logic in your backend.

## Features

A form may look like something simple, but Arengu supports tens of out-of-the-box features that will save you several weeks of development and maintenance:

* Multi-step forms.
* Improved form inputs.
* Inline validations.
* Compatibility with old browsers.
* Double validation on client and server side.
* Validations against external web services.
* Partial validations with data signing.
* Automatic notifications on submission.
* Safe payments processor.

Furthermore, as soon as you connect the form to our [Flows](/product/flows/) module, the savings double.

## First steps

Take a look at our [Fields](/product/forms/fields) section to discover all the different types of data that may be handled. Once you know the fields you need, explore the [Multi-step](/product/forms/multistep) section to learn how you can structure your form.

If you have to collect [Payments](/product/forms/payments), read carefully what providers we support. Probably you will want to check our [Validations](/product/forms/validations) strategy or even know how to add your own checks using our [Flows](/product/flows/) module.

Now that you are a master, relax and check th [Submissions](/product/forms/submissions) page while we process your leads.
