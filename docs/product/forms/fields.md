Depending on the type of field you choose, you have a different set of rules to configure. Furthermore, if you have to add an advanced validation, you can create a validation flow and link it to your form.

To make sure malicious users do not introduce invalid data, unlike other competitors, all our data validations are performed on both server and client side.

### Date/Time format

Form does not accept any date that does not satisfy the chosen format. If you have to ask for a full date (including hour), use two different fields with date and time format respectively.

**Useful for:** Asking the user her birthdate or a slot for a demo.

**Available for:** [Date](#date-field) field.

### Default value

Sets a value that will be assigned to that field when the user does not specify a value. This default value is assigned by backend, so it works even if you use a standard HTML form or the API.

The specified value must satisfy any additional requirement or server will return an error. For example, if you set a minimum length, the default value cannot be shorter than the specified length.

**Useful for:** Setting a default department on contact request or assigning a standard priority on issue report.

**Available for:** [Yes/No](#yes-no-field), [Choice](#choice-field), [Date/Time](#date-time-field), [Dropdown](#dropdown-field), [Email](#email-field), [Number](#number-field), [Phone](#phone-field), [Text](#text-field) and [URL](#url-field) fields.

### Maximum length

> This rule does not omit whitespaces when validation is performed.

**Useful for:** Validating length of promotional codes.

### Minimum length

## Settings

Every field can be configured by determining its settings. These are the available settings to personalize the fields of your form. Apart from these, each field may have particular settings of its own.

### Hint Text

It adds an additional text below the label. For instance, in order to add a small explanation for the users. It supports dynamic values based on previous user values.

### Label

It shows or hides the main label of the field. To change the text on the label, click on it on the form editor. It supports dynamic values based on previous user values.

### Placeholder

It adds additional information that is displayed in the form field. It is often used to display the format of the value, in order to ease the filling process for the submitters. For instance, when indicating the format of a promotional code: _AA123_.

### Required

It sets a form field as mandatory. If a field is mandatory and the user does not fill it, the form will not be submitted.

### Transient

It avoids field data to be stored in Arenguâ€™s systems.

To ease the setup of your forms, some form fields come with predefined settings. For instance, passwords are a sensitive datum â€” you probably do not want your usersâ€™ passwords to be stored in Arenguâ€™s systems, so this field is marked as transient by default.
