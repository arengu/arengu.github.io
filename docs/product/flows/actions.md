title: Actions
---

A flow is composed by a list of one or more actions that are executed sequentially. Each action has a specific goal that determines the input that it expects, its implementation and the output that it produces.

## Properties

Regardless of the type of action you have defined, every action has a group of common attributes:

* Identifier: It references univocally that specific action. Useful for variables replacement.
* Alias: Human explanation of the goal of that action. Optional.
* Type: It specifies the application our action integrates with.
* Action: Based on the action type, it indicates the operation that it performs.

Besides the previous fields, each action has a set of parameters that varies in function of the type.
