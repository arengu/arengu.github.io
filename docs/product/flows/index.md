With Arengu you will have access to a wide variety of functionalities without writing a single line of code:

* Scalable system for events handling.

* Advanced validations for your forms.
* Avoid exposure of your business rules.
* Tens of native integrations with third parties.
* Extendable with your own HTTP integrations.
* Ready-to-use debugging system.

Furthermore, we continue developing new features and improving the platform continuously.

## First steps

First at all, analyze the [Types](/product/flows/types) of flows we support and how you can invoke them by configuring [Triggers](/product/flows/triggers). As soon as you configure it, add some [Actions](/product/flows/actions) to define your logic.

Your flow is ready, so enjoy and check occasionally the registered [Executions](/product/flows/executions). If a flow fails, check the recorded [Errors](/product/flows/errors) and analyze the execution using our [Debugging](/product/flows/debugging) platform.
