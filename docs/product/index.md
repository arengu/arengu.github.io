## Arengu 101

We are sure you already browsed [our website](https://www.arengu.com/) several times, but we will remind you some key concepts one more time to speak a common idiom.

### What we do

Arengu provides you a set of tools to build your user onboarding process without development overhead, security risks nor maintenace. You can focus on lead conversion while we do the hard work.

### How we do

We offer you two different modules that work together to increase the onboarding experience of your potential clients on a completely transparent way.

On the one hand, our [multi-step forms](/product/forms/) let you design and implement user friendly forms compatible with modern web browsers without giving up security nor GDPR requirements.

On the other hand, our [advanced workflows](/product/flows/) empower your forms adding complex validations against your web services, enriching your data with external sources or propagating your data to third providers.

Furthermore, if you have to manage multiple projects or there are several people involved in them, the [built-in workspaces](/workspaces) system helps you to isolate their data in different contexts and control access per person.

## First steps

Are you already convinced? Continue reading this page because you will not regret!

### Introduce you

First of all, you have to [create your own account](https://admin.arengu.com/#/signup) or you will not be able to continue. The signup page contains a very simple form that allows you to create forms after filling in a few fields.

### Quick guides

Once you have activated your account, you should follow any of the following manuals in function of your needs to create a form or flow quickly.

* Work in progress. Guides will be available soon.
* Work in progress. Guides will be available soon.
* Work in progress. Guides will be available soon.

> The previous list was built based on the typical needs that our clients have. If you think we should add another scenario, send us your suggestion and we will include it as soon as possible.

### Going deeper

You already have an account and a ready to use form but you need more complex functionalities than the described ones. This documentation will help you to become a master and perfect your onboarding processes.

Probably you do not have to know everything we explain in this documentation the first day, so focus on the essential parts and read the rest of the documentation when you need.
