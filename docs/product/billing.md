Billing plans depend on the number of operations coming from Arengu’s submissions per month, as well as other advanced features.

## Sharing workspaces

If you share a workspace with someone, the operations and functionalities associated with its flows and forms are billed exclusively to the workspace’s owner, regardless of the person who manages it.

This billing system lets you share different workspaces with several employees, paying only one premium account instead of paying multiple plans to manage the same resources.

## Advanced features

If you have to include a premium functionality in at least one of your forms or flows, the workspace owner will have to pay any of the billing plans that support it.

Once the owner pays for a set of advanced features, all the members of that workspace will be able to use it as long as all the forms or flows that use them belong to their workspace.

## Counting operations

At the end of the month, the amount of operations that the workspaces you own is calculated. This is based on a sum of the amount of accepted submissions plus the amount of flow actions executed.

This count does not include forms or flows belonging to workspaces created by other users even if you have created the form or you have added a premium field.

## Exceeding quotas

If your project scales up and you exceed the number of operations allowed to your billing plan, you will receive an email informing you and suggesting a plan upgrade but the service will not be suspended.

If no action is taken and the situation becomes regular, you will receive a warning with a fixed deadline. If the date arrives and the problem continues, the service will be immediately interrupted.
