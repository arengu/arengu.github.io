Our flows module is a powerful tool for defining advanced validations or processing form submissions. They even are useful for implementing business logic using our infrastructure.

## Features

Using our platform you will have access to a wide variety of functionalities without writing a single line of code:

* Scalable system for events handling.
* Fault-tolerant leads processor.
* Advanced validations for your forms.
* Avoid exposure of your business rules.
* Tens of native integrations with third-parties
* Extendable with your own HTTP integrations.
* Ready-to-use debugging system.
* Tools for data enrichment and text processing.

Furthermore, we continue developing new features and improving the platform continously.

## First steps

First at all, analyze the [Types](/docs/flows/types) of flow we support and how you can invoke them configuring [Triggers](/docs/flows/triggers). As soon as you configure it, add some [Actions](/docs/flows/actions) to define your logic.

Your flow is ready, so enjoy and check occasionally the registered [Executions](/docs/flows/executions). If a flow fails, check the recorded [Errors](/docs/flows/errors) and analyze the execution using our [Debugging](/docs/flows/debugging) platform.
