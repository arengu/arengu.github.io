Our forms module allows you to capture leads without spending any minute developing the form in your frontend nor the related business logic in your backend.

## Features

A form may look something very simple, but we support tens of features out-of-the-box that will save you several weeks of development and maintenance:

* Multi-step forms.
* Improved form inputs.
* Inline validations.
* Compatibility with old browsers.
* Double validation on client and server side.
* Validations against external web services.
* Partial validations with data signing.
* Automatic notifications on submission.
* Safe payments processor.

Furthermore, as soon as you connect the form to our [Flows](/docs/flows/) module, the savings double.

## First steps

You should start taking a look at our [Fields](/docs/forms/fields) section to discover all the different types of data that we handle. Once you know the fields you need, explore the [Multi-step](/docs/forms/multistep) section to learn how you can structure your form.

If you have to collect [Payments](/docs/forms/payments), read carefully what providers we support. Probably you will want to check our  [Validations](/docs/forms/validations) strategy or even how to add your own checks using our [Flows](/docs/flows/) module.

Now you are a master, so relax and check the [Submissions](/docs/forms/submissions) page while we process your leads.
